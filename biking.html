    <h2>Theme 02: Basic Content</h2>
 <h2>02.01.02. XD prototype, 02.01.05. Treatment, 02.01.07. Storyboard, 02.01.08. Documentation, 02.01.09 PDF with Links to micro site</h2>
   <p>This was my first group project and I learned the importance of communication with partners and the responsibilities you get as you have your own role in the project.</p>
   <p>Creating a prototype wasn't a new thing but finding a joint decision and trying to listen to everyone's ideas was a challenge.</p>
   <p>I learned more about the importance of camera angles and placement, microphones, lighting, focus, and everyone's roles in the filming crew to produce the best quality of the work.
   </p>
   <p>
       It was also a process during which we needed to create a story with new knowledge of the Aristotle narratice curve, which taught how every part of the story is vital, the prelude needs to be engrossing and the viewer needs to be drawn to the plot so the climax and the fade out would feel rewarding. To this also contributes dramaturgic elements like light, space, sound, move and time. For these reasons creating a detailed storyboard with different shots, specific time durations and sounds was crucial for the work.
   </p>
   <p>
       In the making of the project we were also introduced to the usability test which lead us to understand user experience better and improve our work. The results and other parts such as moodboard, style tile, design principles applied were important to document to understand the process better and improve.
