    <h2>Theme 02: Basic Content</h2>
 <h2>02.01.03. Link to Video: Story without words</h2>
   <p>For this project we needed to form small groups to create a short 1 minute video without any words and preferbly music.</p>
   <p>In this theme I also was introduced Adobe Premiere Pro program which was my first time working with video and sound. I learned about the importance of lighting, focus, camera placement and angles (close ups, creative, over the shoulder, wide, long shots). Even though I had no experience the process went pretty smoothly and in my group I was the editor while other two girls worked on the story and filming/recording.
   </p>
   <p>The process of creating a continous video of various different short clips was challenging but also let me be creative. I learned that you take great responsibility with the role you have in the group.</p>
